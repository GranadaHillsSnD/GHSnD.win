      <h2>Welcome to the Granada Hills Speech and Debate Team!</h2>
        <p>Public speaking is quite possibly one of the most underrated, yet most valuable skills that one can possess in high school and have available for the rest of his or her life. Public speaking is one of the most significant ways to communicate with others, increase one’s self-confidence and social skill set, and, most importantly, make a profound difference in one’s community. By influencing how others think, it allows countless opportunities to create significant, positive change in the world around you.</p>

        <p>Speech and Debate is an academic activity that involves members competing in a/an event(s) that test one’s proficiency at public speaking. We at GHCHS Speech and Debate are guided by our love for self-expression and public speaking. If you love public speaking and wish to use it as a medium to express who you are as an individual, then this team is an incredible opportunity for you. If you want to develop your confidence and increase your proficiency at communicating with others, we will definitely help you accomplish that. If you’d like to increase your skill at presentations and interviews while also widening your professional skillset, this is the perfect place to hone those abilities.</p>

        <p><strong>The Speech and Debate Team is split into two categories, speech and debate. Each category features multiple different events, all of which are very unique and valuable in their own right.</strong></p>

        <p>Speech events are split into four main categories: <strong>Originals</strong>, <strong>Interpretations</strong>, <strong>Spontaneous Events</strong>, and <strong>Congressional Debate</strong>.</p>

        <p class="category"><strong>Originals: </strong>This category is for students who wish to express original ideas and original works. Originals provide a great platform for students to deliver a speech on a topic they are passionate about or to deliver an original work. Events include Original Oratory, Original Advocacy, and Original Prose and Poetry.</p>

        <p><strong>Original Oratory (OO): </strong>Students deliver a self-written, ten-minute speech on a topic of their choosing. Limited in their ability to quote words directly, Original Oratory competitors craft an argument using evidence, logic, and emotional appeals. Topics range widely, and may be informative or persuasive in nature. The speech is delivered from memory.</p>

        <p><strong>Original Poetry and Prose (OPP): </strong>In Original Prose and Poetry students write and present their own pieces composed of original prose, poetry, or a combination of prose and poetry. This event provides an opportunity for “creative” writers to present their work to an audience. The material may be humorous, dramatic, or a combination of the two. The competition in this event is challenging because the material varies so widely. OPP combines the originality of oratory and the creativity of interpretation.</p>

        <p class="category"><strong>Interpretations: </strong>This category focuses on reciting and interpreting previous works from authors, movies, monologues, speeches, theatrical productions, and other sources. This is the perfect category for actors and theatrical people. Interpretations focus on students providing an original interpretation of their works, not simply reciting them. Events include Original Interpretation, Dramatic Interpretation, Duo Interpretation, and Humorous Interpretation.</p>

        <p><strong>Oratorical Interpretation (OI): </strong>Oratorical Interpretation is an individual event that requires students to find a published speech that was delivered in a public forum. This speech event encourages students to understand the relationship of an oration to the times that inspired it. Students must analyze and understand the goals and motivation of the original speaker, and interpret the oration with a whole new voice to a whole new audience.</p>

        <p><strong>Dramatic Interpretation (DI): </strong>Using a play, short story, or other published work, students perform a selection of one or more portions of a piece up to ten minutes in length. With a spotlight on character development and depth, Dramatic Interpretation focuses on a student’s ability to convey emotion through the use of a dramatic text. Competitors may portray one or multiple characters. No props or costumes may be used. Performances may also include an introduction written by the student to contextualize the performance and state the title and author.</p>

        <p><strong>Duo Interpretation (Duo): </strong>Two competitors team up to deliver a ten-minute performance of a published play or story. Using off-stage focus, Duo Interpretation competitors convey emotion and environment through a variety of performance techniques focusing on the relationships and interactions between the characters. No props or costumes are used. Performances may also include an introduction written by the students to contextualize the performance and state the title and author.</p>

        <p><strong>Humorous Interpretation (HI): </strong>Using a play, short story, or other published work, students perform a selection of one or more portions of a piece up to ten minutes in length. Humorous Interpretation is designed to test a student’s comedic skills through script analysis, delivery, timing, and character development. Competitors may portray one or multiple characters. No props or costumes may be used. Performances can also include an introduction written by the student to contextualize the performance and state the title and author.</p>

        <p><strong>Humorous Interpretation (HI): </strong>Using a play, short story, or other published work, students perform a selection of one or more portions of a piece up to ten minutes in length. Humorous Interpretation is designed to test a student’s comedic skills through script analysis, delivery, timing, and character development. Competitors may portray one or multiple characters. No props or costumes may be used. Performances can also include an introduction written by the student to contextualize the performance and state the title and author.</p>

        <p class="category"><strong>Spontaneous Events: </strong>This category is all about brainstorming, formulating an argument, and delivering a speech (or speeches) on the fly and on the spot. These events are great for just about everyone, especially spontaneous people with a quick wit and debaters who want to practice speaking spontaneously. The topics in these events range widely, from comical and lighthearted to professional and political. This category is different from other categories in that they can’t be rehearsed and require experience and practice above all else.</p>

        <p><strong>Impromptu: </strong>Impromptu is a public speaking event where students have two to five minutes to select a topic, brainstorm their ideas, outline and deliver a speech.  The speech is given without notes and uses an introduction, body, and conclusion.  The speech can be light-hearted or serious.  It can be based upon prompts that range from nursery rhymes, current events, celebrities, organizations, and more.</p>

        <p><strong>Spontaneous Argumentation (Spar): </strong>In Spontaneous Argumentation, or Spar for short, two competing students are given a topic or resolution and have 1 minute to brainstorm and outline their argument, then have 1 minute to deliver an oral argument in favor of or against the resolution. Students then cross examine each other for 3 minutes straight and then give 1 minute speeches individually with no preparation. This event is great for both naturally spontaneous speakers and those who want to improve their on-the-fly speaking. Prompts range from light-hearted and casual, philosophical, and current events.</p>

        <p><strong>Extemporaneous Speaking (Extemp): </strong>In United States Extemporaneous Speaking, students are presented with a choice of three questions related to current events in the U.S. and, in 30 minutes, prepare a seven-minute speech answering the selected question. Students may consult articles and evidence they gather prior to the contest, but may not use the Internet during preparation. Topics range from political matters to economic concerns to U.S. foreign policy. The speech is delivered from memory.</p>

        <p class="category"><strong>Congressional Debate (Congress): </strong>A simulation of the U.S. legislative process, students generate a series of bills and resolutions for debate in Congressional Debate. Debaters alternate delivering speeches for and against the topic in a group setting. An elected student serves as a presiding officer to ensure debate flows smoothly. Students are assessed on their research, argumentation, and delivery skills, as well as their knowledge and use of parliamentary procedure.</p>

        <p><strong>Debate has less events but is more focused overall. The debate events include:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Lincoln Douglas (LD): </strong>In this one-on-one format, students debate a topic provided by the Association. The debate is philosophy based and usually theoretical in nature, describing what ought to be done or what is morally correct to do. Lincoln-Douglas Debate topics range from individual freedom versus the collective good to economic development versus environmental protection. Students may consult evidence gathered prior to the debate but may not use the Internet in round. An entire debate is roughly 45 minutes and consists of constructive speeches, rebuttals, and cross-examination.</p>

        <p><strong>Public Forum (PoFo): </strong>Public Forum Debate involves opposing teams of two, debating a topic concerning a current event. Proceeding a coin toss, the winners choose which side to debate (PRO or CON) or which speaker position they prefer (1st or 2nd), and the other team receives the remaining option. Students present cases, engage in rebuttal and refutation, and also participate in a “crossfire” (similar to a cross-examination) with the opportunity to question the opposing team. Often, community members are recruited to judge this event.</p>

        <p><strong>Policy Debate (PD): </strong>A two-on-two debate that focuses on a policy question for the duration of the academic year, this format tests a student’s research, analytical, and delivery skills. Policy debate involves the proposal of a plan by the affirmative team to enact a policy, while the negative team offers reasons to reject that proposal. Throughout the debate, students have the opportunity to cross-examine one another. A judge or panel of judges determines the winner based on the arguments presented.</p>

        <p><strong>Parliamentary Debate (Parli): </strong>Parliamentary debate is a formal contest featuring critical analysis and rhetorical skill. Participants represent the advocates for and against a motion for debate (also known as a resolution or topic). A motion is presented as the subject for debate. A different topic is used for each round of debate. Two teams, each with two persons, prepare to debate the topic. The teams have twenty minutes of preparation time from the announcement of the motion to prepare for each debate. Students may consult other students, dictionaries, reference materials, and prepared notes during the preparation period. There is no preparation time once the debate commences. No prepared materials may be brought into the debate round for the debater’s use. Debaters are not permitted to read published material in the speeches of the debate to support their argument claims.</p>

        <p>The sheer amount of events in both speech and debate may seem overwhelming at first, but students typically find their preferred event(s) within the first few tournaments or, at the very least, well before the first semester ends. The events truly allow for any and every form of self-expression possible. We at the GHCHS Speech and Debate Team are more than willing to help our members become better and more efficient speakers with whatever event they choose to do.
